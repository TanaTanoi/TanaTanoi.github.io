	  <text>
	    From the brains of a designer and artist duo on the indie gem Mini Motorways comes Shape Sender Deluxe! What started as a little puzzle two-person side-project has evolved into a fully fledged narrative puzzle experience with a talented team. The game uses physics puzzles to explore the relationship between developers and players with a fun, witty, slightly concerning best-friend Sendy.

	  		The game takes inspiration from a variety of places, like The Incredible Machine, Portal, The Beginner's Guide, and more, but the influence of Dinosaur Polo Club's design philosphy is not hard to find either. It's gameplay dripping with a very tailored player agency; minimalist, polished visuals; and Wuselfaktor (the satisfying sensation of watching rhythmic or living systems and machines).
